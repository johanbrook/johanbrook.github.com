		<p>After a complete rewrite during the weekend, my barebones starter theme for WordPress is up at GitHub. It provides a basic HTML5 structure with <a href="#">partials</a>, lots of handy helper functions, and a couple of setup configurations. Check out the ReadMe and try it out. It evolved from my own habits when creating WordPress sites, so the GitHub repo also serves as a great location to store the files and access them from anywhere.</p>
		
		<p>It’s only a skeleton, so no styling is included (check out my Sass framework for that). Frequently used Javascript libraries are included though, as well as a suggestion on a .htaccess file.</p>
