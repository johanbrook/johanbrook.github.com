> If someone claims to have the perfect programming language, he is either a fool or a salesman or both

In 1985 Bjarne Stroustrup created the C++ programming language, much because of his and his colleague’s frustration with C. Today C++ is everywhere and is in my opinion the mainstream and “godfather language” for beginners to get accustomed with. I remember my excitement and interest when I got a “Learn To Program C++ in 24 Hours” book for Christmas once. Then picture my excitement when I, Johan, wrote – created – my first usable program (a Celsius-Fahrenheit converter). Long live C++.
